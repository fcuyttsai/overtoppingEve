#Wave overtopping predictor
### Deep Convolution neural network for predicting wave overtopping at coastal structures

Y.T Tsai and C.P Tsai, email:yuttsai@fcu.edu.tw

This specific pre-trained convolutional neural network(CNN) allows you to input the geometric and hydraulic parameters for accurate wave overtopping predictions.

If you are interesting the pre-trained model and execution code, please following the link:

We also make an execute file with google colab:
